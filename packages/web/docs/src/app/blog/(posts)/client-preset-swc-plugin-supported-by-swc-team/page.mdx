We're excited to announce that the Client Preset
[SWC plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-codegen/client-preset-swc-plugin) is now
officially part of the
[swc-project/plugins](https://github.com/swc-project/plugins/tree/main/contrib/graphql-codegen-client-preset)
repo - maintained and supported by the SWC team!

To use the new package, simply install it:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @swc-contrib/plugin-graphql-codegen-client-preset
```

Then, use it in place of the old package:

```ts
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  // ...
  experimental: {
    swcPlugins: [
      [
        '@swc-contrib/plugin-graphql-codegen-client-preset',
        { artifactDirectory: './src/gql', gqlTagName: 'graphql' }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

For other use cases, check the
[updated documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/presets/preset-client#swc-plugin)!

This plugin has been an essential part to
[reduce bundle size](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/presets/preset-client#reducing-bundle-size)
when integrating Client Preset into frameworks with SWC, such as Next.js and Vite. However, SWC
plugins are currently not backwards compatible which means every time there was a new release in the
`swc_core` package, `@graphql-codegen/client-preset-swc-plugin` version needed to be updated.

We created [an issue](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/10379) to gather
thoughts from the community on how to move forward with (1) guaranteed stability of the package and
(2) minimal involvement from Codegen maintainers. Almost immediately,
[@kdy1dev](https://x.com/kdy1dev) (Donny, the creator of SWC) made the suggestion to move the
project to `swc-project/plugins`, which solved all the problems!

Needless to say, this is a great solution for the community. Again, big shoutout to Donny for
supporting us!
